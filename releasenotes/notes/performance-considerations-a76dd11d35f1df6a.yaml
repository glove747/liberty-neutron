    The following performance considerations are important when deploying
    the Liberty version of Neutron.
issues:
  - The stock Ubuntu Trusty Tahr kernel (3.13) shows linear performance
    degradation when running "ip netns exec" as the number of namespaces
    increases. In cases where scale is important, a later version kernel
    (e.g. 3.19) should be used. This regression should be fixed in Trusty
    Tahr since 3.13.0-36.63 and later kernel versions. For more information,
    please see `this <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1328088>`_
    bug.
  - Creating Neutron-LBaaS load balancers in environments without hardware
    virtualization may be slow when using the Octavia driver. This is due to
    QEMU using the TCG accelerator instead of the KVM accelerator in
    environments without hardware virtualization available. We recommend
    enabling hardware virtualization on your compute nodes, or enabling nested
    virtualization when using the Octavia driver inside a virtual environment.
    See `this link <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/devstack/guides/devstack-with-nested-kvm.html>`_
    for details on setting up nested virtualization for DevStack running inside
    KVM.
