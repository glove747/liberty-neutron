    Neutron routers underwent some changes and enhancements during Liberty
    around L2 population integration, VPNaaS, and segmentation types.
features:
  - Router high availability (L3 HA / VRRP) now works when layer 2 population
    (l2pop) is enabled.
  - VPNaaS reference drivers now work with HA routers.
  - Networks used for VRRP traffic for HA routers may now be configured to use
    a specific segmentation type or physical network tag.
fixes:
  - See `this <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1365476>`_ bug for
    more details on the fix L3 HA and L2 population.
  - See `this <https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1481443>`_ bug for
